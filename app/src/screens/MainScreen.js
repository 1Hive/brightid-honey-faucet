                Honey is 1Hive's community currency
              </Link>
              . Similar to Bitcoin or Ether, Honey is issued and distributed by
              an economic protocol, and can be freely exchanged on a distributed
              ledger. When you hold Honey you are betting on the Honey economy
              growing over time, and you can help realize that goal by staking
              your Honey on distribution proposals which allocate Honey issuance
              towards the initiatives that help 1Hive thrive.

              This faucet allows you to claim Honey just for being a human and
              showing interest in 1Hive... but if Honey is Money, why would we
              want to just give it out like that? The answer is that having a
              broad and inclusive distribution of Honey is critical for the
              1Hive community to grow and decentralize. In the early days of
              Ethereum and Bitcoin, it was possible to mine Ether and Bitcoin on
              a personal computer and this resulted in a broad and inclusive
              distribution. In principal this faucet operates on the same basic
              premise, but instead of proof of work we rely on
              <Link href="https://www.brightid.org/">BrightID</Link> for sybil
              resistance.

                Honey distribution proposals
              </Link>
              , anyone can make a proposal to top up the faucet with more Honey,
              and if there is sufficient support it will happen. The faucet will
              allocate a portion of its balance to all registered users each
              period, when a user claims their share they will automatically be
              registered for the next periods distribution. If you forget to
              claim your share, it will be forfeited and you will need to
              re-register before claiming again, so be sure to check back in and
              claim your share each period!
